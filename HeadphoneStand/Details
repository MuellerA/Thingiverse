[Summary]
Yet another Headphone Stand. But this one is customizable, see the image above for the available options. The .STL files were created with Height=205, Length=50 and Angle=70.

There is one more option for round edges, which is disabled in the online Customizer because it takes a long time to generated the .STL file.

If you want a customized version with round edges you have to

    download and install OpenSCAD (www.openscad.org)
    load the headphonestand.scad file in OpenSCAD and edit the variables at the top
    press F5 and wait for the first time
    press F6 and wait for the second time (if you get an error - I most times do - select "Design/Flush Caches" from the menu and press F6 again)
    select "File/Export/Export as STL..." from the menu
