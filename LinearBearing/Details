[Title]
Linear Bearing (SCS6UU, SCS8UU)

[Summary]
This Thing is only useful in combination with [mightynozzle's](https://www.thingiverse.com/mightynozzle) [Customizable Linear Bushing / Bearing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2202854).

First create the LM*n*UU STL file with [Customizable Linear Bushing / Bearing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2202854).
Then include the created STL file in this OpenSCAD file to create the SCS*n*UU linear bearing STL file.
As "include" does not work in the online customizer you have to use OpenSCAD.
