[Summary]
AA, AAA, C and D battery replacement (or use the Customizer to create a different size). [mofosyne](https://www.thingiverse.com/mofosyne) created an [easier to print version](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3285906)

Getting annoyed of an always empty battery I created this, put a cheap Chinese 5V to 1.5V buck converter inside and attached an USB-A connector to it.
