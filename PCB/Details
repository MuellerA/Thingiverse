[Summary]
When playing with electronics I don't like the PCBs lying around naked. So I made them some nice Victorian trousers to wear.

As all PCBs are different, the trousers are customizable. Unfortunately the online Customizer does not work, so you have to install OpenSCAD.

The file "use"d as a OpenSCAD library may be useful when designing the furnishings of an electronic modules case.
